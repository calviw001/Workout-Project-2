# Workout-Project-2
The second workout project from ICS 32 class.

This program manipulates the words of a text file into something harder to decipher. The program will first read in a text file and take in a secret key from the user. Then, the program will use that secret key to scramble up the words of the text file and finally, output those scrambled words into another text file. The user will be able to tell the program what text file to read from and what file to write in by typing in the command line (ex: python wp2.py originaltext.txt newtext.txt).
